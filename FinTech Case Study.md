# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Lemonade Insurance Company
* Slogan - Instant everything.  Incredible prices.  Big heart.

* Lemonade was founded in 2015 and went public in 2020. 

* Daniel Schreiber, a lawyer by training who had also dabbled in internet security, was looking for an opporturnity for a tech start-up and felt that the insurance industy needed some disruption.  He teamed up with software coder Shai Winninger to sketch out their idea for a new kind of insurance company.  They brought on Ty Sagalow, an insurance insider, to contribute industry knowledge.

* Schreiber correctly asserts that "every person in the nation, in the world, needs insurance."  He also notes that many people don't trust traditional insurance companies.  

* Lemonade has raised a total of $480 million from groups such as SoftBank, GV (Alphabet), Thrive Capital, Allianz, General Catalyst, and OurCrowd.  Its current funding is in the secondary market.


## Business Activities:

* People need to have insurance - property insurance (such as homeowners), auto insurance, and life insurance.  However traditional insurance processes are time-consuming and cumbersome, and rates are high in many areas of the United States due to a high number of catastrophic claims.  

* Lemonade has been described by Forbes as "Millennial-friendly."  The company counted 425,000 customers, and 75% of them were under 35.  Quite simply, the advantage offered by Lemonade is technology.  The company utilizes technology at the start of the insurance buying process and throughout the life cycle of the policies it writes.  
*  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

* Lemonade has been described as a "bot over broker" insurance company.  When a customer visits the Lemonade website or mobile app, he or she can obtain a quote using Maya, Lemonade's artificial intellgence bot.  Maya asks a series of questions and uses the data gathere to return a quote within minutes.  Behind the seens, Lemonade used machine leanrning to gather various data points about the potential customers.  The company has not clarified what these datat points are.  After Maya returns a quote, a graphical representaiton shows what the policy will cover.  There are optional endorsements a customer can add to his or her policy.  Policy management is done through the app, including filing claims.  Lemonade also uses articial intellgence - another bot, named Jim - in the claims process.  As part of that process, the AI uses facial recognition technology and runs machine learning algorithms to analyze videos uploaded by the customer to detect fraud.  If potential fraud is detected, the claim is turned over to a human for investigation.  Businses who might have need to offer their customers access to Lemonde, such as insurance brokers and financial planners, can request access to the company's API for integration with an existing website.  It uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, algorithms, a claims bot, a mobile app, and behavioral economics.
