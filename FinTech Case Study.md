A well-known saying asserts that the only sure things in life are death and taxes.  One might add insurance to the list of sure things in life.  As Daniel Schreiber, co-founder and CEO of Lemonade Insurance notes, "every person in the nation, in the world, needs insurance."  Insurance is a financial vehicle that touches everyone's life in one way or another.  We insure our homes, our cars, our health, and our lives.  The insurance market is large, with premiums totalling $1,276.8 billion dollars in 2020, split into $652.8 billiion (51.1%) for the property and casualty market, and $624 billion (48.9%) for the life and annuity market.  Many factors are driving growth in the insurance industry, and more and more players are entering the market.  The newest players are all digital companies, offering a range of insurance products on websites and mobile apps.  These companies promise to make the processes of insurance, from buying policies to paying premium and filing claims, easier for consumers.  Lemonade Insurance is one of these digital companies, promising "instant everythin."  It has been described as a "bot over broker" insurance company.    

## Overview and Origin

Lemonade was founded in 2015 by Daniel Schreiber and Shai Winninger.  Schreiber is an attorney by training and had also started a start-up internet security firm.  He was looking for an opporturnity for a new tech start-up and believed that the insurance indusrty was perfect for tech disruption.  He teamed up with Winninger, a  software coder to sketch out an idea for a new kind of insurance company.  The qualities they identified for their ideal insurance company were low premiums, ease of doing businses, and trust worthiness.  Neither Schreiber nor Winninger had any insurance experience.  They considered their status as industry outsiders a plus but recognized the need for some expertise within the insurance domain.  So they brought on Ty Sagalow, an insurance insider, to contribute industry knowledge. 

Lemondae started writing homeowners and renters policies in 2017 and later expanded to writing pet insurance and life insurance.  The company takes 25% of premiums to cover administration costs and fees and 75% of premiums to pay claims.  Anything left over is donated to charity.  According to its website, Lemonade has donated $2,303,381.24 to charity.

Lemonade has raised a total of $480 million from groups such as SoftBank, GV (Alphabet), Thrive Capital, Allianz, General Catalyst, and OurCrowd.  Its current funding is in the secondary market.  The company went public on the New York stock exchange in 2020.

## Business Activities

To overcome the time-consuming process of writing policies and settling claims, Lemonade makes heavy use of technology on its website and mobile app.  When a customer visits the Lemonade website or mobile app, he or she can obtain a quote using Maya, Lemonade's artificial intellgence bot.  Maya asks a series of questions and uses the data gathered to return a quote within 90 seconds.  Behind the seens, Lemonade used machine leanrning to gather various data points about the potential customers.  The company has not clarified what these datat points are.  After Maya returns a quote, a graphical representaiton shows what the policy will cover.  There are optional endorsements a customer can add to his or her policy.  

Policy management is done through the Lemondae app, including filing claims.  Another AI bot, named Jim, is used in the claims process.  In filing a claim, customers upload a video of themselves to the app.  The AI uses facial recognition technology and runs machine learning algorithms to analyze the video to detect potential fraud.  If potential fraud is detected, the claim is turned over to a human for investigation.  If the AI does not detect the possibility of fraud, the app settle the claim and money is deposited into the insured's linked bank account.  About 30% of claims filed with Lemonade are handled fully electronically. 

Businses who might have need to offer their customers access to Lemonde, such as insurance brokers and financial planners, can request access to the company's API for integration with an existing website.  

Lemonade's heavy use of technology appeals to younger insurance buyers.  It has been described by Forbes as "Millennial-friendly."  The company counted 425,000 customers, and 75% of them were under 35.  Quite simply, the advantage offered by Lemonade is technology.  The company utilizes technology at the start of the insurance buying process and throughout the life cycle of the policies it writes.  The ability to purchase insurance, manage policies, and file claims all from a mobile app provides time savings for customers, which is appealing to younger customers.  Much of Lemonade's initial growth was from its renter's insurance market.  Customers purchasing renters insurance tend to be younger.
 
Lemonade's stategy of appealing to younger buyers is a good one, considering that 80% of Millenials and Gen Zers have at least one insurance policy.  As these younger generations grow, they will insurance prodcuts to their portfolio.  Indeed, Lemonade has found that much of its homeowners business has come from renter's purchasing homes and converting their Lemonade renters policies to homeowners poilcies.  

## Landscape

Over the past 10 years, insurance companies have made significant improvements in technology.  Carriers have upgraded aging websites and rating systems and introduced mobile apps.  Newer carrier rating systems make use of integration with information sources, such as LexisNexis, state department of motor vehicle systems, and county appraisal district data, to pull customer data into a quote.  Auto insurance carriers also offer telematics programs that use a mobile app and/or a "dongle," which is connected to the computer system in the customer's vehicle, to monitor insured driving habits and customize the rate.  The J.D. Power 2020 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study found that "insurers have made across-the-board improvements in clarity of information, but many still struggle with the balance of too much information and a minimalist approach."  

Lemonade is working to cement itself as a player in the insurance domain, relying heavily on technology to do so.  As an InsurTech company, it uses technology to provide a minimalist approach in terms of quick quoting with as little input on the customer end as possible and much data mining on the backend of the process.  Lemonade has also leveraged technology to simplify and speed up the claims process.

Other all digital carriers are competing for their piece of the market share pie.  Esurance (owned by Allstate), Insurify, Root Insurance, Clearcover, Metromile, and Kin Insurance are a few of the competitors on the property and casualty side.  Traditional insurers are also making heavy use of technology to improve their operations.  State Auto Insurance, a regional carrier, has an all digital platform.  Even giants like Travelers have robust websites, mobile apps, and make use of telematics and data mining.


## Results

Lemonade is not a major disruptor in the insurance market - yet.  Lemonade's growth since it wrote its first poicies in 2017 has been impressive.  In three years the company reached the million customer mark (for comparison, State Farm took 22 years to reach that milestone).  In its first 10 months, the company's annual revenue was $10 million, and after two and a half years, its annual revenue was over $100 million.  In 2021 Lemonade has seen a decline in revenue, due in part to the catastrophic freeze in Texas in February.  This event was an anomaly in the insurance landscape and is affecting every insurer in the Texas market.  In addition, Lemonade altered its reinsurance arrangement in the third quarter of 2020, which has reduced its revenue and resulted in falling stock price.  However, the company shows steady premium growth and expects to grow its 2021 premium.  

Lemonade's financial strength, its ability to pay claims, appears to be excellent.  Demotech, Inc., has given Lemonade an A "Exceptional" financial stability rating.  The gold standard rating of an insurance company's financial strength is an AM Best Rating, but AM Best has not yet rated Lemonade.  The company  closed its first year with a loss ratio (paid claims divided by earned premium) of 166%, well above the industry norm of 65% to 70%.  As Lemonade's experience grew, it adjusted its practices and reduced its loss ratio to 71% in 2020.  The loss ratio bumped back up, to 121% in the first quarter of 2021 but dropped to 74% in the second quarter of 2021.  This shows that Lemonade is learning to manage risk.

If Lemonade can continue to grow, the company will be a big disrupter in the insurance market. It is planning to launch an auto insurance product soon.  Shai Wininger, COO and co-founder of Lemonade, states that the company's auto insurance product "will use technology to handle emergencies and pay claims fast, will offer great prices to safe drivers, and will be especially attractive to drivers of EVs (electric  vehicles) and environment-friendly cars." The auto insurance market is a $300 billion market, and a piece of that pie would serve Lemonade very well.

## Recommendations
 
Lemonade should proceed with its plan to enter the auto insurance market. According to Matthew Frankel, CFP, of The Motley Fool:

>They don't have to convert all of their customers. Auto insurance is just a valuable market. The average U.S. customer pays $139.50 a month in auto insurance premiums. The average renters insurance customer, which is Lemonade's bread and butter right now, pays $15 a month. I did the math before the show, if they can convert 14% of their customers into auto insurance customers, they would double their in-force premium. That's a nice growth market, especially something that they're seeing "overwhelming demand for.

Being technology and data driven, Lemonade should utilize telematics in determining auto rates.  The company could add the telematics capability to their mobile app to monitor customer driving habits.  This data would be more data added to Lemonade's data sets, allowing the company to further refine its underwriting processes.

After introducing an auto product, an umbrella product would be an excellent addition for Lemonade.  Umbrella policies tend to be premium generators for insurance companies, and Lemonade would already have the necessary customer data from writing homeowners and auto policies to write umbrella policies.  In fact with continued data gathering and use of machine learning, Lemonade could expand its product offerings to the broad range offered by traditional insurance companies.
