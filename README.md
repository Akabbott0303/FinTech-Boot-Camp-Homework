# A Case Study of Lemonade Insurance Company

Described as a "bot over broker" insurance company, Lemonade is not a major disruptor in the insurance market - yet. However, it has grown greatly since its inception in 2016.  Lemonade sets itself apart from traditional insurance companies in its heavy use of technology throughout the life cycle of every insurance policy, from quoting to claims handling.  If Lemonade can continue to grow - and the data suggest it will - then the company will eventually be a big disrupter in the insurance market.
